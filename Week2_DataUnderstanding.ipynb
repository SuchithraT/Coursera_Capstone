These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by a variety of entities, such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road-networks. Currently, there are about 3.5 million accident records in this dataset.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>1. Traffic Attributes</b> - These attributes helps to find the severity of an accident with traffic information. The column \"Severity\" its a target attribute to predict the accident severity in most of the scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we can predict the occurance of accident by extracting  year, month, day, hour, weekday and time_duration from Start_Time and End_Time column. i.e, When the accident happens most, whether it's Weekdays or Weekend\n",
    "\n",
    "- ID: This is a unique identifier of the accident record.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Source: Indicates source of the accident report (i.e. the API which reported the accident.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- TMC: A traffic accident may have a Traffic Message Channel (TMC) code which provides more detailed description of the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Severity: Shows the severity of the accident, a number between 1 and 4, where 1 indicates the least impact on traffic (i.e., short delay as a result of the accident) and 4 indicates a significant impact on traffic (i.e., long delay).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start_Time: Shows start time of the accident in local time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- End_Time: Shows end time of the accident in local time zone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start_Lat: Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Start_Lng: Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the start point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- End_Lat: Shows latitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- End_Lng: Shows longitude in GPS coordinate of the end point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance(mi): The length of the road extent affected by the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description: Shows natural language description of the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To Clear the Accident & to visulaize the accident we can extract 'End_Time' (we have start time), 'Duration', 'End_Lat', and 'End_Lng'(we have start location)  attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, Features 'ID' doesn't provide any useful information about accidents themselves. It considered as a useless attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>2. Address Attributes</b> - To find/Predict where do the most accidents happens like Country, City, Zipcode, Street, Side\n",
    "\n",
    "- Number: Shows the street number in address field.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Street: Shows the street name in address field.\n",

    "\n",
    "- Timezone: Shows timezone based on the location of the accident (eastern, central, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>3. Weather Attributes</b> - These attributes which helps us to fpredict the in what weather condition the most accidents happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "To predict the severity of an accident based on weather condition is important. Because Weather-related vehicle accidents kill more people annually than large-scale weather disasters(source: weather.com). According to Road Weather Management Program, most weather-related crashes happen on wet-pavement and during rainfall. Winter-condition and fog are another two main reasons for weather-related accidents. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Airport_Code: Denotes an airport-based weather station which is the closest one to location of the accident.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weather_Timestamp: Shows the time-stamp of weather observation record (in local time).\n",

    "- Humidity(%): Shows the humidity (in percentage).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pressure(in): Shows the air pressure (in inches).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Visibility(mi): Shows visibility (in miles).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wind_Direction: Shows wind direction.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Weather_Condition: Shows the weather condition (rain, snow, thunderstorm, fog, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>4. Period-of-Day</b> - Below attributes predicts when do the accident happens most, whether its in day/night time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sunrise_Sunset: Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on sunrise/sunset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Civil_Twilight: Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on civil twilight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Nautical_Twilight: Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on nautical twilight.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Astronomical_Twilight: Shows the period of day (i.e. day or night) based on astronomical twilight.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>5. POI Attributes</b> - It predicts in which POI the serious of accidents happens. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Amenity: A Point-Of-Interest (POI) annotation which indicates presence of amenity in a nearby location.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Bump: A POI annotation which indicates presence of speed bump or hump in a nearby location.\n",
