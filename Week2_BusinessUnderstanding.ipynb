    "#### Motivation / Business Problem\n",
    "  As a nation on wheels, driving around is part of the life. Imagine You are driving to another city for work or to visit friends. It is rainy and windy and on the way, you come across the terrible traffic jam on the other side of the highway. Long lines of cars are barely moving. As you keep driving police car start appearing from afar shutting down the highway. Its an accident and there's a helicopter transporting the ones involved in the crash to the nearest hospital. They must be in critical condition for all of this to happening. \n",
    "  \n",
    "  Now wouldn't be great if there is something in place that could warn you given the weather and road conditions about the possibility of you getting into a car accident and how severe it would be, so that you would drive more carefully or even you change your travel if you are able to. \n"

Because, Weather-related vehicle accidents kill more people annually than large-scale weather disasters\n",
